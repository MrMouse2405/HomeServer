# Webserver Stuff

Includes several resources including:
- Source Code for my portfoilo website.
- Source Code for DDNSUpdater

## DDNS Updater

Basically, it's a simple script for updating DNS records if my ISP changes the public ip address.


## Bell CS Club

Simple websites made for Club members to use,
hack into (for cyber security stuff), and for other
uses.
